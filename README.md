WordPress starter theme.

Work In Progress.

Brief overview...
- has php composer, npm, and phpunit setup in the root of the wordpress install.
- might use scss (I really dislike less)
- might setup an es6 transpiler
- provides a basic theme directory structure and bootstrapper
- uses j-masci/wp-helpers (still have to add the sub module to git)
